 🐦 Bird Migration Analysis - Power BI Project

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of bird migration patterns using Power BI. It aims to uncover insights into the behavior, geography, and temporal aspects of bird migration through visual storytelling and interactive dashboards.

📊 Project Objectives

- Understand bird migration patterns over time and across regions.
- Identify stopover points and migration durations for individual birds.
- Visualize geographic paths using map visuals.
- Explore species classifications and behavioral trends.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for conservation.

📁 Files Included

- `Bird_Migration_Report.pbix` – The main Power BI report file.
- `README.md` – Project description and documentation.

 📌 Key Features

- Interactive dashboards with filters by species, region, and time.
- Map visualizations showing GPS-tracked migration routes.
- Calculated metrics for migration duration and stopovers.
- Analysis grouped into 8+ thematic questions (patterns, geography, time, classification, etc.).

 🛠 Tools Used

- **Power BI** – for data modeling and visualization.
- **Power Query** – for data transformation and cleaning.
- **DAX** – for calculated columns and measures.

📚 Data Source

The dataset was provided as part of a data challenge and includes GPS coordinates, bird IDs, timestamps, and scientific classifications.

 📈 Insights Extracted

- Most birds migrate between [Region A] and [Region B].
- Average migration duration is X days, with Y stopovers on average.
- Some species show earlier migration than others, depending on climate conditions.

 🚀 Future Work

- Integrate weather data to enrich migration analysis.
- Add predictive modeling using machine learning tools.
- Publish an interactive version of the dashboard online.
